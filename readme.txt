The Opimizely client lives in a provider called global.ts.

This way, we can include it in all relevant components and see what variations / features the user should be in.

This also allows for track calls to be added to events on the page.

When you navigate to the "About" page, you will see a message with the variation you are in.

If you click the button below the message, it will send an Event back to Optimizely.
